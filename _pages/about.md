I'm a senior developer advocate for [Rasa](https://rasa.com/), where I'm helping devlopers build and deploy ML chatbots using our open source framework. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

I have a PhD in Linguistics fromÂ [the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). My research was on [computational sociolinguistics](https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2017/06/13/what-is-computational-sociolinguistics-and-whos-doing-it/), or how our social identity affects the way we use language in computational contexts. Previously I was [a data scientist at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman) and I'm still a Grandmaster. 

Here's my current streaming sechdule. You can tune in on [my Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rctatman/) or [the Rasa YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0V6493mLvqdiVwOKWBODQ/live).
