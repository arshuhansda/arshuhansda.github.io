My research has been discussed in many publications, including [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737017-you-can-train-your-gadgets-understand-what-youre-saying-world) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/good-girls-revolt/510245/). If you're a reporter, I'm always happy to chat about my research or data science in general. You can find my contact information in the left sidebar.
