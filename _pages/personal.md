When I'm not working, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy gaming: both video games and strategic boardgames. I also knit, crochet and spin. My Ravelry id is rctatman and I've even been known to release the occasional knitting pattern. In addition, I really enjoy circus arts, especially dance apparatuses like dance aerial sling and [dance trapeze](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1qfrdynfqxyuyr/rachael_TrapeezePiece.MTS?dl=0). I even [danced my PhD on the Trapeeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fct1QBv1oWE)!

I had an African Pygmy Hedgehog named Gustav, who [apparently preferred Python to R](https://twitter.com/rctatman/status/992065377378095106). He passed May 2020. You can find [a memorial scrapbook I've put together here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cjg8dwuv3g5uzq/gustav_book.pdf?dl=0).
